Version [Version Number] ([Friendly Version Number]) [Release Date]

Version 1.1.5.0 (1.1.5) 2009-11-30
	General description:
		Some minor bug fixes were fixed for this release, project code was cleaned up, and unit testing library
		was almost completely rewritten. 
	
	Bug fixes:
		-When configuring an provider with no default constructor the thrown exception was not very descriptive.
		-SqlLoggingProvider and AspNetSqlLoggingProvider threw NullReferenceException (WorkItem 4763)
		-Logger threw TypeLoadException when invalid value was set in type attribute (WorkItem 4762)
		-DebugLoggingProvider did not log in release builds. (WorkItem 4721)
		 The logger called the static Trace.Write method which was marked with the ConditionalAttribute.
		-Fixed a typo in the Obsolete attribute of the LoggerWrapper class.
		-Fixed one of the exception messages that was thrown in case the logging provider failed to initialize.
		 The message incorrectly referred to an error in the <configSections> section.
	
	Code changes:
		-Several typo's in code comments and XML comments fixed.
		-A lot of refactoring done, such as:
			-Code in CuttingEdge.Logging assembly cleaned up.
			-SR (String resources) class now uses more convenient format methods instead of static fields.
			 By using methods, code coverage (NCover) can signal which resource messages aren't used.
			-Unit testing library almost completely rewritten. A lot of tests were badly named or tested too
			 much. Many tests were added to achieve better coverage percentage.
		-The Obsolete attribute on the LoggerWrapper class is now flagged as compile error. The LoggerWrapper
		 will be removed in a later release.
	
	Changes to project and solutions:
		-New project CuttingEdge.Logging.Tests.Integration added. This test project needs a SQL server database
		 to test the SqlLoggingProvider and AspNetSqlLoggingProvider.
		-Project CuttingEdge.Logging.Tests.Common added and AppDomain sandboxing classes moved to this library.
		-Project CuttingEdge.Logging.UnitTests is renamed to CuttingEdge.Logging.Tests.Unit.
		-InternalsVisibleToAttribute defined in CuttingEdge.Logging assembly (debug mode only) to allow
		 better Unit Testing.
		-'Treat warnings as errors' is now selected in project settings.
		-StyleCop.Settings file is moved to solution folder. Unit Test project overwrites some settings.
		-TRACE flag is now on in release builds
		

Version 1.1.0.0 (1.1) 2009-03-15
	General description:
		This new release fixes two bugs and adds a new provider: the MailLoggingProvider.

	Bug fixes:
		-Dependency with the type ‘System.Web.Configuration.ProvidersHelper’ removed. There were two problems
		 it’s use:
		 1. The used 'InstantiateProvider' method throws exceptions without specifying a possible inner
		    exception (see the bug report on 
		    http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=411215 for more 
		    information).
		 2. Use of the type caused the to the loading of the System.Web assembly and the check of ASP.NET 
		    hosting permissions, while the CuttingEdge.Logging framework is a general framework that could
		    also be used in non-web based environments.
		-WindowsEventLogLoggingProvider now also logs the severity of the event to the event log. Two new unit
		 tests added to check the format of that logged message.
	
	Code changes:
		-A new MailLoggingProvider has been added. It's a simple provider that uses the <system.net> 
		 configuration from the application configuration file to send events by mail.
		-A LoggerExtensions class added containing extension methods for the ILogger interface. These
		 extension method replace the LoggerWrapper class which is now marked as obsolete.
		 
	Changes to project and solutions:
		-Reference to System.Core (.NET 3.5) added. Officially, the project is now dependent on .NET 3.5, but 
		 it will still run on .NET 2.0. When adding the assembly to a .NET 2.0 project just ignore
		 the warning by choosing "Yes".
